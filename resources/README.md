By default, GeoServer 2.8 RC1 is downloaded and deployed to the image.

To customize the GeoServer version used by the image, put a `geoserver.zip` file (containing the `geoserver.war` WAR archive) and a `app-schema-plugin.zip` file (containing the app-schema extension JAR files) here and they will be picked instead.
